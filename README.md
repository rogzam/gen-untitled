# gen-untitled

A continuation to an attempt to recreate artworks from computer-generated art pioneers as an excuse to get more comfortable with p5.js!In this case I tried to replicate one of Georg Nees' untitled artworks, published by Werkstatt Edition Kroll in 1970. It consists of a grid of polygons with increasing segments inscribed within the perimeter of circles. 

The circles are arranged in a seemingly random fashion, and the polygons become progressively more complex as the segments increase. The artwork was programmed on a Siemens System 4004, which was a pioneering computer system for graphics and image processing at the time. 'Untitled' is considered a significant work in the field of computer art, and it demonstrates Nees' innovative use of geometric forms and his skill in creating complex, visually stunning compositions with simple programming techniques.
